* tt_ctrl and tt_mux are the modules to be hardened independently
* tt_um_example is the template of User module
* tt_um_test is a test user module used for test bench
* tt_user_module is autogenerated from the tt_user_module.yaml config file that assigns user module IDs to given position in the grid. If a grid position doesn't have a module, it will be "stubbed off" automatically
* tt_top / tt_user_module are "pure-wiring" (i.e. they have no logic, just wires) and are what will end up in user_module_wrapper.v, connecting all the things.
* You'll see the hardened modules often have "constant outputs", this is because the tt_top/tt_user_module sometime need to tie-off some ports to constants and this provide convenient tie-off points.
